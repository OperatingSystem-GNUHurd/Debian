  * The Hurd console may now be started automatically on bootup.  The
    file `/etc/default/hurd-console' controls whether the Hurd console
    will be started, and if so, which options are used.  To get the 
    Hurd console on bootup, change ENABLE to `true' and adjust the
    other options to your liking.

hurd (20050119-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The command line syntax for the console client has slightly
    changed.  It is no longer necessary or even allowed to specify the
    consnode path to the short `-c' option (e.g. `-c /dev/cons'),
    /dev/cons is implied as default (but can be changed using the long
    option, `--consnode=FOO').  When using the mouse or keyboard
    repeater, the console client command line should now be as follows:
      console -d vga -d pc_kbd --repeat=kbd -d pc_mouse --repeat=mouse \
        -d generic_speaker -c /dev/vcs
