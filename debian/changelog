  [ Michael Banck ]
  * debian/changelog: Added back 20040301-1 entry which got lost.
  * debian/hurd.install: Do not install /sbin/fsck. (Closes: #272655)
  * debian/patches/rc.patch: Updated to use e2fsprog's /sbin/fsck
    command-line options.  Make sure the root file system is read-only
    during the fsck run, and update it to be writable again if fsck
    succeeds. (Closes: #273508)
  * debian/patches-contrib/ext2fs_20040930.diff: New file.  Just put it
    in debian/patches and recompile the package to get (experimental)
    support for ext2 files systems larger than 2GB.
  * debian/control (Maintainer): Changed Maintainer address.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * debian/hurd.postinst:
    - Move /bin/login suid root chmod to debian/rules.

    + Together with gnumach 1.2-9, you can access large stores with

    + pfinet contains support for network ioctls. The corresponding
    changes in the glibc library are not available in Debian yet, though.
