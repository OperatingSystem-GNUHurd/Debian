Order for building binary distribution:

1) Make tools on build machine
*   Build/install libc and header files from mach and hurd.
*   Build/install gcc (just LANGUAGES=c)
*   Build/install binutils.

2) Make everything for release; install both on build machine and dist dir.
*   Build/install binutils again (now using new as and ld).
*   Build/install gcc again.  (only one stage necessary).
*   Build/install libc again.
*   Build/install everything else.

See `release-steps' for Hurd source release steps.

Checklist for binary image filesystems

*   Symlinks in /bin; esp. sh, awk, more, cc.
*   Symlink /lib/libtermcap.a -> /lib/libncurses.a, termcap_g.a, 
	curses_g.a, curses.a.
*   Symlink /lib/ld.so -> /lib/ld.so.1.
*   Symlink . -> /usr.
*   Make sure directories exist: /tmp, /var/run.
*   Touch /var/log/wtmp.
*   Check all symlinks to make sure they don't reference /gd4.
*   Don't use absolute symlinks--make them all relative.
*   Build some static fileutils: ls, ln, cp, mv, chmod.
*   Make damn sure that we are only distributing the md5 libcrypt.
*   Make sure /include/obstack.h is from libc and not binutils.
*   Make sure there is no /include/i386.
*   Make sure there is no /i486-gnu.
*   Make sure we are using Hurd versions of su and uptime, not sh-utils.
*   Make sure we are using Hurd fsck, not e2fs.
*   Make install-dist from release dir.
*   Make sure there is only a stubby resolv.conf in the distribution.
*   Make sure /etc/fstab has no active members
*   Make sure nethack is clean
*   Make sure localtime is Factory
*   Source code for Hurd and libc must be released.
*   Remove .stamp files from binary tree.
*   Chown everything root.wheel, mode 755/644.
*   /tmp is 1777.
*   Chown /games games.games.
*   Check permissions on set[gu]id files in binary tree.
       (login, su, addauth, setauth, ids, ps, w, vmstat, vminfo, rsh, rlogin,
        games/lib/nethack/nethack)
*   Check each directory for bogus cruft files.
*   Especially delete .bash_history, .gnunfs*, and .stamp files, *~, *.rej
*   Verify installation on bare machine.
*   Make sure everything listed in SOURCES is on prep.
*   Install release
*   Post announcement


FSF Hurd machines need in addition to the INSTALL-binary installation:

*   our NFS translators
*   our kernel
*   sendmail.cf, /etc/aliases
*   /home/* symlinks
*   /etc/syslog.conf
