This directory contains tools and scripts useful in setting up Hurd
binary distributions.  None of it is installed by default, but it's
provided here for those who might find it helpful.

Use `make install-dist dist-root=FOO' to install the files that go
into the root of binary distributions.

Use `make install-tools tool-root=FOO' to install the tools that are
used to build binary distributions.
