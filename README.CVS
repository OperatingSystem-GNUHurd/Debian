GNU Hurd CVS version.


This is the Hurd.  Welcome.

For installation instructions, you might try your luck with the files
README, INSTALL, and INSTALL-cross.  However, they have not been
updated for a long time.

For now, this file documents the version requirements for the CVS
version of the Hurd.  Other combinations might work, but the stated
minimum requirements are best tested by the developers.

GNU MiG		at least 1.3
GNU Mach	at least 1.3
GNU C library	CVS from 2004-03-09 or later
GNU C compiler	at least 3.3.2

Optionally, a Sun RPC implementation is needed to build the NFS
translator and daemon:

GNU C library   at most 2.13
TI-RPC          (currently fails to build on GNU, see
                 <http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/12/msg00007.html>.)

Obviously, you also need somewhat recent versions of binutils, make,
bash and some other tools.  No hard requirements are currently known
for these, though.
